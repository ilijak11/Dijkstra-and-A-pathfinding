# Dijkstra-and-A*-pathfinding implementation and visualization

1. By clicking on the specific node int the node matrix select start and end node
  (if you want to change the start/end node, click on it again and select new start/end node)
2.  By clicking the "Draw walls" button you can draw obstacles by dragging the mouse across the matrix
  (drag the mouse again across the obstacles to erase them)
3. Choose the speed and the algorithm
4. Start the simulation
5. You can repeat the same simulation 
6. Clear the matrix and draw again
